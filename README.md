- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I first found this project to be a little bit daunting because of the image features. These features including clicking on thumbnails to portray larger image, while also including CSS depending on which image is selected.  The mobile version also included buttons to navigate forwards and backwards through the images.  While viewed on larger screens, users are able to click on the large image, opening a shadowbox of photos. 

I found these challenging because I had never created them before.  But, I used my instincts and pushed forward.  I'm really proud that I was able to reuse the image component for the shadowbox and, by sending props, make a few changes to create the needed design.  

What I learned most from this project, was that I can do anything if I think about it and push through!  Though this may not be the best way of doing it, I learned a lot through the journey and am really proud of my results. 

### Continued development

As mentioned, I feel like there could be a better way to code this design. I'm sure there are tools already created that easily allow for the creation of shadow box images.  One thing that was lacking in this project, which I've already started to work on, and can continue to work on, is that this example only has one item.  The cart functionality could have been programmed statically, but I moved forward and made it more dynamic so that new items can be added in the future.
